Ok the next step is to pick the right compatible version of  mifos components
1. Server
2. WebUi
3. Android Client

Currently when checked the fineract war file that I downloaded from mifosx site or where it tells the last meaningful 
release is 16.12.01.RELEASE. Sounds idiotic as it is based on the date

How did I bring Structure payment support in UI
1. EnumOptionData - added toString method
2. LoanProductsApiResource.java - added a sysout to indicate that this is a changed sourcecode
3. AmortizationMethod.java -  Added additional getter method - isWhiteSpace
	Previous version
		EQUAL_PRINCIPAL(0, "amortizationType.equal.principal"), //
		EQUAL_INSTALLMENTS(1, "amortizationType.equal.installments"), //
	    	INVALID(2, "amortizationType.invalid");
    	Current version
	    	WHITEPACE_INSTALLMENTS(0, "amortizationType.equal.whitepsace"),
	    	EQUAL_PRINCIPAL(1, "amortizationType.equal.principal"), 
	    	EQUAL_INSTALLMENTS(2, "amortizationType.equal.installments");




4. InterestMethod.java - Added additional type and removed invalid
5. LoanApplicationTerms
	-There were lot of places where the amortization method and interest method were accessed
	-Changed all of them to reflect the whitespace method
6. DefaultLoanScheduleGeneratorFactory.java
	-Removed invalid method and added whitespace methods
7. LoanEnumerations.java
	-Removed invalide method and added whitespace methods for both amortization and interesttypes
	-Line 267 and 288
	-This is the place where the UI label is set
8. build.grade-Added additional exclusion types for rat
	-.recommenders/**',	
	'.metadata/**',
9. gradle.properties
	-changed releaseVersion	

How am I trying to bring up the table in the loanproduct ui
1. I have made changes  CreateLoanProductController.js 
	- added a new function addLoanSchedule

2. Added a new table in createloanproduct.html
	-Added support to generate multiiple entrires	


There is something about angular js, that is really attractive to me. I sense that the mvc has found its way in the rightt finally in the web world.
Atleast it gives me an oppurtunity to work on UI code, with wout wracking my brain. What I really find interesting and helpful is the part where
the UI code lives entirely separate from the server and the data exchange happens between them completelty through json. That kind of gives me
a sense that I can confidently work with the belief that it is true mvc.

ResourceFactory.js -  the place where all the controllers are defined.
loanProductResource - The controller that I am currently interested.
	- supported methods
		getAllLoanProducts
		save

Well I have a hit roadblock when I was trying to perform a save with the changes that I made to the client code
1. The submit button itself did not work, when I had the schedule table created
2. The submit failed, stating that the scheduleMatrix field is 
	The parameter `scheduleMatrix` has been passed and is not supported for this request.

So I am looking around currently, find out who exactly is passing this error back.
1. its 400, so its indeed server generated
2. There are bunch of classes that I am going through
	org.apache.fineract.portfolio.loanproduct.api.LoanProductsApiResource.createLoanProduct(String)
		This seems like the starting point and it calls commandsSourceWritePlatformService, which manifests as
			PortfolioCommandSourceWritePlatformServiceImpl	
	LoanProductConstants - contains all the parameters required for the loan configuration
	LoanProductConfigurableAttributes - This potentially seems to be place for the change, however i am not really sure at this point
	LoanProduct - Also seems to be a candidate

However with all this still put in, I am still not sure from where the 400 error is being thrown.
Ok When I went back and started searching, I could use the error message ' has been passed and is not supported for this request.' 
and trace it back to the locale json which has all the labels
	-locale-en.json - line 347 - error.msg.parameter.unsupported
Then I took that error message and searched for a clue, then I got back the class that was using this error message and it turned out to be
UnsupportedParameterExceptionMapper. And this is getting called in a class called ErrorHandler, which is what is writing the 400 error
back. Plus it is being called from some batchservice, that kind of leaves me cold in the trail. Nevertheless, I am going to do dumpStack
and figure from where the exception is coming from, next.

And I got into another mess
As I was changing the scheduleMatrix variable in CreateLoanProductController.js from formData to scope.
I forgot to consistently make the changes in createloanproduct.html which made me go through a lot of
pain, as I was struggling to find out what was happening. Everything worked(the onclick event, called the function, but there
was no result, because I have changed the variable. Quite a simple mistake, but a costly price !!!)

Wow, this was a crazy session of coding - March 8 2017
1. I had first faced the issue not being able to create the schedule . The reason was, I did not properly mention the variiable in createloadproduct.html page where the table was getting created.
2. Once, I fixed, then I realized that the scheduleMatrix was not properly attached the form data that was submitted
3. Then I realized that it was form submit rather than a javascript induced form submit - I am still not sure about this though, because what I receive inside the app is a json graph? So how come ?
4. And finally in the server side, there was a loanvalidation module - LoanProductDataValidator called by LoanProductWritePlatformServiceJpaRepositoryImpl.createLoanProduct(JsonCommand) for validating the incoming 
json graph,
5. I added the scheduleMatrix variable and finally made the error go away.
6. Now I need to complete the loop


CREATE TABLE `m_product_loan_schedule` (
  `id` bigint(20) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `installment_no` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  `installment_amount` decimal(19,6) DEFAULT NULL,
  `installment_principal` decimal(19,6) DEFAULT NULL,
  `installment_interest` decimal(19,6) DEFAULT NULL,  
  `loan_product_id` bigint(20) NOT NULL,  
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `LOAN_PRODUCT_ID` (`loan_product_id`),  
  CONSTRAINT `FK_LOAN_PDT` FOREIGN KEY (`loan_product_id`) REFERENCES `m_product_loan` (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;




I am trying to watch the sequence of creating loans
LoanScheduleAssembler.assembleLoanScheduleFrom(LoanApplicationTerms, boolean, List<Holiday>, WorkingDays, JsonElement, List<LoanDisbursementDetails>) line: 612	
As I was going through this process, I got tripped off by another exception that  said something the loanschedule increment is wrong.
And it took some time for me to realize that some odd debugging session would have left the tables in inconsistent state. So I truncated all m_loan% tables and reran transaction to success!!

I checked if the fix was ok, but running through the process twice


LoanScheduleModel and LoanScheduleModelPeriod - are the data models
LoanScheduleModelPeriod is an interface and it as two implementations,
1. For disbursal - 
2. Another for repayment  - 

org.apache.fineract.portfolio.loanaccount.loanschedule.service.LoanScheduleAssembler.assembleLoanApplicationTermsFrom(JsonElement, LoanProduct)

This seems to be the place of action for creating the schedule

Keeping the system waiting too long on the debugger is actually creating havoc


Most of schedule generation code is with the abstractscheduler itself. all we need to do is to give the principal and interest for the current period number

In Loan application terms, I have changed it to use loanproduct reference

There a lot of pending items that need to be addessed
1. I have not paid respect to localization standards
2. I have still not added support fo schedule lifecycle for edit, view
3. I hava one nullpointer issue that i need to addess
4. I have added apache license for our code, which I need to remove
5.  I have not added any validation so far
6.  i have to have a reset button set along with the create schedule

Check-in summary in all the changes meant for the structured payment option - first label
1. ErrorHandler - printStackTrace added in line 72
2. CommandSource - Added a sysout in line 100
3. PortfolioCommandSourceWritePlatformServiceImpl.java - Added sysout line 93

The biggest issue that I faced was, that the instruction that was made available in the documentation
was prettty incomplete. Here are the pointers
1. DestinationDb and SourceDb were missing in simple-jndi/jndi.properties
2. Existing configuration was all about hsql
3. shell scripts were missing in 1.3 release, I had to go and check them out of 1.2 release
4. Shell scripts had no help section
5. Data import for mifoswarehouse were all embedded in mifos_bi
6.
